# VIM

This is my personal VIM setting which is mainly inspired by [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). It is optimized for MacVIM.
I started to use VIM with Janus but felt that it would be better to build up my own `.vimrc`. The benefits are better
control of configs, less unused plugins and a higher learning curve.

#### Getting started
1. I store all the backup and swap files in a central folder i.e. use this command `mkdir ~/.vim/.backup ~/.vim/.swp ~/.vim/.undo` to create those directories.
2. Clone the `.vimrc` in your root folder and then run `:PluginInstall` in VIM since I use Vundle as a package manager.
